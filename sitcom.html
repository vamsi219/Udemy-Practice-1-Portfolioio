    <h2> My Top 3 Sitcoms of all time</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>Big Bang Theory</h3>
    <p>Has a great rewatch value. Very witty and funny one liner jokes. Funny nerdy and comic stuff done by the main characters which is difficult to show for 12 seasons, but yet managed to rock till the end.</p>
    <h3>Brookyln - 99</h3>
    <p>The Twists and story writing is brilliant and the goofy stuff done by the police detectives is very fun to watch, brilliant from first episode to last episode.</p>
    <h3>Modern Family</h3>
    <p>Ahead of time. Great to watch for stress busting. Great Character development. Again great writing, even the child actors make you laugh very much.</p>
